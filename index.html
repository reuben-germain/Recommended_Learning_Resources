            <ol>

                <li>Define your goals and choose a programming language: Determine which area of software development
                    interests you the most, such as web development, mobile app development, or data science. Based on
                    your
                    interests, select a programming language to focus on, such as <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>Python</em>,
                    or
                    <em>Java</em>.
                </li>

                <li>Start with online tutorials and courses: There are numerous free learning resources available online
                    that can help you kickstart your learning journey. Here are five recommended platforms: <br><br>
